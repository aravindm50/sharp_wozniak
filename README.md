Problem Statement : 
PSLOVE challenge, given a set of data from real women on their menstruation cycles collected from the existing PSLOVE iOS app.
Data given include duration of the cycle, duration of the menstruation, and symptoms experienced severely by them such as nausea, bloatiness, headache, backache, diarrhoea and all.

Medical Insight :
Symptoms experienced by women before the occurence of a period tend to recur in a predictable manner and may be used to predict the occurrence of the next period. Women who are trying to get pregnant will benefit from knowing their fertile period around which ovulation occurs. Girls who are aged 8 to 15 years may be concerned about when their first period will occur unexpectedly.

AI :

Initial tried with K Means clustering and found out at that 2 clusters are prominent. Later adopted symptoms to be output and input to be cycle from period, periodd days and last period as input

Integration :
Technical challenge faced when trying to port the trained model onto the android mobile platform, attempted with chaquopy.
